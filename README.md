# Binary-Search-Tree

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem I was solving in the projects was efficiently organizing and manipulating data for courses and their prerequisites. This involved reading the course information from a file, creating course objects, and sorting them alphabetically based on the course names. The problem was to implement this task using the recommended data structures that I chose, considering efficiency, memory usage, and implementation. I chose the Binary Tree.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I first made sure I fully understood the requirements and constraints of the project. Then, after evaluation, I selected the most suitable data structure to represent the course information. In this case, I chose a Binary Tree due to its ordering properties, which facilitate efficient sorting and searching operations for the course data. Data structures are important to understand because they provide the foundation for organizing and manipulating data effectively. By understanding different data structures and their characteristics, I was able to select the most suitable data structure for the task at hand. The choice was able to significantly impact the efficiency and performance of the program.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Roadblocks I encountered were understanding the implementation of the Binary Tree and debugging errors in the code. To overcome these roadblocks, I leveraged the course material, as well as online resources, to deepen my understanding of Binary Trees and their operations. I also used iterative problem-solving, breaking down more complex issues into smaller parts, and seeing how they affected the main problem.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work on this project emphasized the importance of selecting the right data structure to ensure the efficiency of the program. It taught me to consider factors such as efficiency, scalability, and ease of implementation when choosing a data structure. It also reinforced the importance of code readability and documentation in software development. Keeping these things in mind, I was able to create an adaptable and efficient solution for the project.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project changed how I write programs. Now, I focus more on code readability. I use clear variable names and write comments that explain what each part of the code does. I also organize my code into smaller parts, so it's easier to work with and change later. I also learned how to make programs that can handle changes well. By dividing the program into different sections and keeping things organized, I made sure that if I need to add or change something later, it won't mess up the rest of the program.
